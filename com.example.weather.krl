      updateWeatherInfo()-------------------------------------------------------

      This function uses the http get method request weather information from
      the darksky api.

      The http:get() function takes one argument: a url in the form of a string.

      A template string can be made using extended the quotes by writing the
      string between << and >>. Extended quotes support the beesting operator,
      making them simple templating systems. Inside an extended quote,
      expression values can be referenced using the #{<expr>} syntax

      The http:get() is a synchronous function, and will return an http
      response. The part of the response we are most interested in is the
      content, which holds the actual weather data from the darksky api.

      The .decode() function after the content will turn the json string object
      and convert it to an object that we can work with and grab data from.

      More information on the krl http library can be found at
      https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189608/HTTP

      More information on beestings and extended strings in krl is found at
      https://picolabs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/docs/pages/1189871/Beestings

      More information on the decode() function and other string operators

      getCurrent()--------------------------------------------------------------

      This function is the function is what actually gets called by your
      manifold app. instead of just returning the current entity variable as it
      is, we alter the icon value stored in it. The darksky api sends the icon
      value back lowercase with dashes in between the words. The skycon library
      we use to display our icons needs the icon values to be uppercase and
      separated by underscores. For example, darksky might send us the icon
      value "partly-cloudy-night." Skycon needs this value to be
      "PARTLY_CLOUDY_NIGHT." The code below gets the icon value and sets it to
      all uppercase with the uc() operator. Then it replaces all the - with _
      using the replace() operator.

      You can learn more about the uc() operator and the replace() operator here
